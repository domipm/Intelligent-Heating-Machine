    "In this first part of the project, our objective is to develop a simple model of the drying process of a drying machine. For reference, we will be focusing on the **Ken Energy Systems IQ6 Washer Disinfector**. This model, although very fundamental, will serve us as a first step towards developing a more sophisticated simulation, with our final objective being the development of a **digital twin** of the machine, which will combine the physics-based simulation and machine learning methods trained on empirically-obtained data to emulate virtually the machine with as little error as possible."

    "The type of dryer considered is a **convective, forced-air, batch, tray dryer**, meaning the objects placed inside (by batches on trays) are dryed by letting hot and dry air to flow over the wet material, which in turn will heat it up, evaporating water, and removing any moisture via convection. Although drying agents (including a different gas mixture) can speed the process, in our case we will be considering air. We will also be ignoring the effects of natural convection (resulting in a mixed convection process) since we will be assuming the air flow velocity due to the external fan will be much greater than the vertical velocity of the air due to natural convection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the model, we will be considering **constant drying parameters**, that is, the inflow of air occurs at constant velocity and with constant properties (temperature and humidity), and **constant air properties**, that is, the temperature and humidity of the air inside the chamber is considered a constant over the spatial dimensions (effectively, we consider average temperatures and humidities for the air).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the main use of this machine is to clean and disinfect medical and surgical tools, we will also assume we are dealing with **stainless steel** materials (or, at least, similar to it). This allows us to assume that the material to be dried is **homogeneous, non-porous, non-hygroscopic**, and the water content is located exclusively at its surface as a thin water layer. We ignore any interactions between the water and the metallic surface (chemical or otherwise), and assume no water content inside the material (there are no pores)."

    "**Drying** can be defined as the separation of moisture from wet surfaces, in our case via evaporation. In a convective dryer, a simultaneous transfer of heat and mass occurs during the drying process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heat transfer**: after putting into contact the drying medium (air) with the wet solid, a temperature gradient sets in and energy in the form of heat is transferred from the hot air to the colder solid. In a convective dryer, this process will occur mainly via **convective heat transfer**. This increases the thermal agitation of the water molecules situated on the thin layer of moisture on the surface of the solid, and allows for evaporation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mass transfer**: the water molecules from the surface of the solid move outwards due to a concentration gradient that sets in between the solid and the surrounding air. These molecules will therefore diffuse into the air and are transported out of the chamber via advection. The mass transfer process that combined this diffusion and advection is the **convective mass transfer**. This process continues until the solid is completely dry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **drying rate** is defined as the mass of water that is removed from the solid per mass of dry solid and per unit time, and it measures how well the dryer is able to dry the solid. In our case, this drying rate depends mainly on the external drying conditions: temperature, humidity, and velocity of the inlet air flow."

    "# Drying of Non-Porous Non-Hygroscopic Flat Slab via Forced Convection with Parallel Airflow under Constant Drying Conditions\n",

    "In order to simulate our drying process, we will consider a simplified model that allows us to solve the equations numerically and study the change in temperature and humidity in the system over time. To do so, we will choose a configuration for which we can estimate the convective heat and mass transfer coefficients. The idea is to study the drying process of a non-porous, non-hygroscopic flat metallic slab via forced convection with parallel airflow under constant drying conditions.\n",

The parameters $h_c$ and $h_m$ will hopefully account for the differences in the airflow properties and changes in geometry between this simplified model and the real system. These parameters can be found either by simply \"guessing\" and calculating reasonable estimations, or using machine learning algorithms that try to optimize the parameters to fit as well as possible the real drying curves obtained in previous measurements.\n",

Constant (external) drying conditions are assumed, meaning the inlet veloctiy, temperature, and humidity are always the same. Inside the chamber, constant air properties are considered, meaning that we assume the temperature and humidity of the air is the same in any spatial point inside the dryer, and we assume that the air properties inside the chamber will not change significantly with respect to the air coming out of the chamber.\n",
