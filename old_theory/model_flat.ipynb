    "# Thermodynamical Model: Drying of Wet Flat Surface with Parallel Airflow"

    "In this first model, which serves as an approximation to the real system, we will treat the drying machine as a one dimensional system, in which we have air entering the drying chamber with a constant velocity, temperature, and humidity level (ideally zero absolute humidity), and with a laminar flow. Inside the chamber is our wet solid, a flat and thin plate, which in the case of stainless steel assume contains all of its moisture in a thin layer at the surface. Assuming an air flow parallel (tangential) to the surface of the solid, a heat transfer sets in between the hot air and the colder solid due to the temperature gradient. This increases the temperature of the solid (and water on its surface) and allows for evaporation. During this process, the air gets slightly colder. With evaporation, water molecules from the moisture surface on the solid diffuse into the air in the chamber, and are effectively carried away by the air flow via convection process. The air absorbs water molecules and therefore increases its humidity level. Finally, exiting the system, air that is slightly more cold and moist exits the chamber, and we can measure both its temperature and humidity via sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are specially interested in modelling the state of the air coming out of the chamber, that is, its level of humidity and temperature. With these values, we can give a good estimate as to the state of the air inside the chamber and subsequently the state of the solid and its moisture content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Characterization\n",
    "\n",
    "The main input parameters are the temperature of the air being inserted into the chamber, the humidity of the air (either absolute or relative, depending on which one we can measure), and the velocity of the air or inflow. The *input* state is given by $x_{\\text{in}} = ({T_d}^{\\text{in}}, {H_A}^{\\text{in}} = 0)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input temperature of the air will be equal to the design temperature $T_d$ chosen on the drying machine. We also want the inflowing air to be dry so that a maximum amount of water can be absorbed in it, and therefore the input air absolute humidity must be as close to $H_A = 0$ as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity of the air $v_{\\text{air}}$ is a parameter which we will consider constant during the whole process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output state is defined as the state of the air coming out of the drying chamber, which we will consider a good approximation of the actual air inside. It will be characterized by the temperature and humidity of the expelled air, whose velocity in this case should be approximately the same as the input velocity (although this parameter is not relevant for our analysis). The *output* state is given by $x_{\\text{out}} = (T^{\\text{out}}, {H_A}^{\\text{out}})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that the steel has a uniform temperature which changes instantly, meaning no conduction inside the steel. Also, we will consider that the thin water layer on the steel surface completely covers the surface area initially and has a thickness of $50$ micrometers, with its temperature being equal to that of the steel surface."

    "## Heat Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "The main heat transfer process is convection between the hot air coming into contact with the colder steel slab and water. In this case, we are dealing with forced convection, where the air flow is driven through external forces (a fan). In contrast, natural convection is the movement of the air due to temperature and density gradients due only to the heat transfer. In some cases, mixed convection occurs, where both processes happen simultaneously. However, in this model, let's assume only forced convection occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also assume that both the trays and the drying chamber walls are adiabatic, meaning they don't exchange heat with the environment nor the air.\n",

    "Here, two main difficulties present. First, the effective surface area to be heated. In this particular simplification of a drying machine, it is clear that the upper surface of the flat steel material is considered, however in real drying machines a more thorough analysis must be performes. Second, determining the heat transfer coefficient is usually complicated analytically, and involves performing fluid dynamic simulations (which may be necessary also to simulate heat transfer in real processes).\n",

    "### Heat Transfer Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Using fluid mechanics, there exists a method of computing the heat transfer coefficient without the need of complex fluid simulations based on correlation theory, where we study the behaviour of the airflow based on various dimensionless parameters, which then through empirical measurements can be related to the heat transfer coefficient.\n",

    "Typically, low Reynolds number indicate laminar flow (where air particles travel parallel) and higher values tend to represent more turbulent flows.\n",
