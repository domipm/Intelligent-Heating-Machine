# Intelligent-Heating-Machine

This repository includes all the code and theoretical background developed for the project "Intelligent Heating Machine" which aims to develop a Digital Twin of a Washing/Disinfectant machine, and specifically, a simulation of the drying process in such machines with the final objective to improve the energy efficiency of such systems. 

The Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) will contain all the mathematical and physical equations and their development, while the main simulation code will be written in Python (.py).
