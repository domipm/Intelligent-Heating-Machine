    "In this section, we will study the convective drying of a solid, non-porous and non-hygroscopic material (for example, stainless steel) with a thin layer of unbound water or moisture, of thickness $\\delta$, which we will assume covers completely the effective drying area $A$ of the object and is spread out uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will treat this as a two-dimensional system, where a flow of dry air ($X_0 = 0$) at a certain temperature $T_{0}$ and velocity $v_0$ incides parallel (tangential) to the surface, whose characteristic length is $L$. The walls and supporting tray inside the dryer are considered adiabatic, meaning no heat is exchanged with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heat Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "The hot air entering the system will transfer heat via convection to the thin water layer on the objects surface. This process implies a heat flow $Q_{\\text{conv,a-w}}$ in the surface air-water (measured in [J/s]). Convection may also heat up the object from its sides, impling another heat flow in the layer air-solid. However, we will assume the object only heats up over the effective drying area which is covered by water, so this contribution can be neglected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the water layer, convection will transfer the heat from its surface to the deeper layers. However, due to the water layer being very thin, we can neglect this contribution and assume its temperature changes uniformly. Similarly, inside the solid, conduction will propagate heat from the upper surface to the interior. Again, we may neglect this term as we can assume a solid also very thin and with a uniform temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a heat transfer will also appear between the water layer and the solid, resulting in different heating rates. This is given by $Q_{\\text{cond,w-s}}$. Between these two layers, convection may also happen, however in smaller temperature cases it can be neglected (as is the case, since both materials have the same initial temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, this heat will be used up mainly in two processes: the increment of temperature, and evaporation of water. For the water surface, we have a latent heat consumption $Q_{\\text{lat,w}}$. Similarly, the solid will also heat up, resulting in a latent heat consumption of $Q_{\\text{lat,s}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaporation process, which only occurs on the water layer surface, will have associated a vaporization heat loss $Q_{\\text{vap,w}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional term $Q_{\\text{loss}}$ can be included to account for heat loss due to other mechanisms. For now, we will neglect this and assume an ideal system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to conservation of energy, the heat gained by the water-solid system due to convection must be equal to the heat lost due to the other processes. Therefore, this leaves us with the following balance equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q_{\\text{conv, a-w}} = Q_{\\text{cond,w-s}} + Q_{\\text{temp,w}} + Q_{\\text{temp,s}} + Q_{\\text{vap,w}}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "For convection, we can make use of Newton's law of cooling:\n",

    "Q_{\\text{conv}} = hA(T_w - T_0)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient to-be-determined.\n",

    "For conduction, we can use Fourier's conduction law:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q_{\\text{cond}} = -k_s(T_w - T_s)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $k$ is the conductivity of the material.\n",

    "The specific thermal heat is related to a temperature change given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q_{\\text{temp}} = m_i c_i \\Delta T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $m_i$ is the mass of the object $i$ and $c_i$ is the specific heat.\n",

The mass of the water $m_w(t)$ will depend on time, and all temperatures $T_s(t)$ and $T_w(t)$ will also depend on time. Thermal conductivity may also change with temperature, $k_s(T)$. Therefore, the heat balance equation takes the form:\n",

Therefore, we will have moist air as output. Since initially, the air is dry, we assume that the vaporization rate is slow enough as to never saturate the air surrounding it, and therefore all the moisture which vaporizes can be absorbed into the dry air.\n",
