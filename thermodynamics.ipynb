For reference,  we will be focusing on the **Ken Energy Systems IQ6 Washer Disinfector**. This model, although very fundamental, will serve us as a first step towards developing a more sophisticated simulation, with our final objective being the development of a **digital twin** of the machine which will combine the physics-based simulation and empirical data to emulate virtually the machine with as litte error as possible."

    "### About the Machine and Wet Material\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of dryer machine we will be studying in this project can be classified as a **convective forced air batch tray dryer**, meaning:\n",
    "- **Convective**: the objects placed inside are dried by applying hot and dry air and removing it via an exhaust. We will assume negligible any other forms of heat transfer (such as conduction or radiation).\n",
    "- **Forced**: the movement of the air flow is due to an external pressure difference, generated by a fan. This is in contrast to natural convection, where the movement of air is due to the displacements of hot and cold patches of air.\n",
    "- Batch tray: the obejcts are placed by batches onto trays, and the drying process stops once the batch is dry, having to unload the machine and place subsequent batches manually.\n",
    "- Air: the drying agent used is dry air (other chemical compounds are sometimes used that allow for better moisture absorption). We will also assume the air to behave as an ideal gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, some assumptions must be made about the machine that further simplify the model:\n",
    "- **Constant air properties**: the local changes in temperature or humidity of the air inside the chamber of the machine are neglegible due to the constant inflow of air which has our desired properties, which are kept constant (or in **steady-state**).\n",
    "- **Steady state air flow**: The inflow of air has constant velocity, temperature and humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stainless Steel Solids\n",
    "\n",
    "The main use of this machine is for cleaning and disinfecting medical and surgical tools. To simplify the model, let's assume we will be dealing with exclusively **stainless steel** objects, such as scissors, scalpels, etc. Some assumptions about the objects to dry:\n",
    "- The material is assumed **homogeneous** and **isotropic** (meaning without any kind of defects and equal in all directions).\n",
    "- This solid is **non-porous** (without any empty spaces within its structure) and **non-hygroscopic** (does not absorb moisture). This effectively means that the wet stainless steel objects can be thought of as having a **thin layer of water on their surface** that contains all the moisture, and they are completely dry on the inside. \n",
    "- Stainless steel has high thermal conductivity, and therefore we can assume the surface of the object will have **uniform temperature**.\n",
    "- We ignore any interactions (chemical or otherwise) between the stainless steel and air or water. That is, we neglect any sorption effects."

    "### Drying Process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drying** can be defined as the separation of moisture from wet surfaces, in our case via evaporation. In a convective dryer, a simultaneous transfer of heat and mass occurs during the drying process:\n",
    "- **Heat transfer**: after putting into contact the drying medium (air) with the wet solid, a temperature gradient sets in and energy in the form of heat is transferred from the hot air to the colder solid. This increases the thermal agitation of the water molecules situated on the thin layer of moisture on the surface of the solid and allow for evaporation.\n",
    "- **Mass transfer**: the water molecules from the surface of the solid are separated from the solid during evaporation, diffuse into the air and are transported out of the chamber, slightly decreasing the total mass of the wet solid until it is completely dry.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-porous materials, evaporation takes places only on the surface of the material, and a layer of saturated air in thermodynamical equilibrium with the wet material appears at the surface. This is a situation analogous to evaporation over a free water surface, with the temperature equal to the wet-bulb temperature (which also equals the temperature of dried material). Drying rate primarly depends on external drying conditions: temperature, relative humidity, and air flow.\n",

    "### Heat Transfer by Convection \n",
    "[Notes taken from Fundamentals of Technical Thermodynamics]\n",
    "\n",
    "In convection, a flow process causes a constantly changing contact between fluid particles of different temperatures, between which energy is transferred by heat conduction. The rate at which heat is transferred onto a surface depends on the surface area of the object $S$, and the temperatures of the solid $T_s$ and air $T_a$, with an additional proportionality constant given by the **heat transfer coefficient** $\\alpha$. Assuming that both the temperature of the solid and the heat transfer coefficient are constants, we can express this mathematically as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\alpha S (T_s - T_a)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat transfer coefficients are difficult to compute mathematically and involves studying the flow regime of the air for the particular geometry of the system. An alternative would be to obtain the coefficient empirically performing a simple experiment (described briefly in book). The mathematical calculation of this coefficient can be performed using **similarity theory** and dimensionless parameters such as the Nu√üelt, Reynolds, and Prandtl numbers (also Stanton number). Another approach: Power Number Approaches for Laminar and Turbulent Flow.\n",

    "where $p_a$ and $p_w$ represent the partial pressures of dry air and water. Dry air has a certain maximum amount of water it can contain, which is reached when the partial pressure of water reaches the saturation pressure $p_s$, which depends on temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the amount of water vapor in air, we can use **absolute humidity** (or humidity ratio), which is defined as the mass of water per mass element of dry air:\n",

    "# First Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first model, which serves as an approximation to the real system, we will treat the drying machine as a one dimensional system, in which we have air entering the drying chamber with a constant velocity, temperature, and humidity level (ideally zero absolute humidity), and with a laminar flow. Inside the chamber is our wet solid, which in the case of stainless steel we assume contains all of its moisture in a infinitesimally thin layer at the surface. Assuming an air flow parallel (tangential or parallel flow) to the surface of the solid, a heat transfer sets in between the hot air and the colder solid due to the temperature gradient. This increases the temperature of the solid (and water on its surface) and allows for evaporation. During this process, the air gets slightly colder. With evaporation, water molecules from the moisture surface on the solid diffuse into the air in the chamber, and are effectively carried away by the air flow. During this process, the air absorbs water molecules and therefore increases its humidity level. Finally, exiting the system, air that is slightly more cold and moist exits the chamber, and we can measure both its temperature and humidity via sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are specially interested in modelling the state of the air coming out of the chamber, that is, its level of humidity and temperature. With these values, we can give a good estimate as to the state of the air inside the chamber and subsequently the state of the solid and its moisture content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Characterization\n",
    "\n",
    "The main input parameters are the temperature of the air being inserted into the chamber, the humidity of the air (either absolute or relative, depending on which one we can measure), and the velocity of the air or inflow. The *input* state is given by $x_{\\text{in}} = ({T_d}^{\\text{in}}, {H_A}^{\\text{in}} = 0)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input temperature of the air will be equal to the design temperature $T_d$ chosen on the drying machine. We also want the inflowing air to be dry so that a maximum amount of water can be absorbed in it, and therefore the input air absolute humidity must be as close to $H_A = 0$ as possible. \\\n",
    "The velocity of the air $v_{\\text{air}}$ is a parameter which we will consider constant during the whole process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output state is defined as the state of the air coming out of the drying chamber, which we will consider a good approximation of the actual air inside. It will be characterized by the temperature and humidity of the expelled air, whose velocity in this case should be approximately the same as the input velocity (although this parameter is not relevant for our analysis). \\\n",
    "Therefore, the *output* state is given by $x_{\\text{out}} = (T^{\\text{out}}, {H_A}^{\\text{out}})$."
